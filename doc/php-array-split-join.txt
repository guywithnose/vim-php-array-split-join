PHP Array Split/Join				*php-array-split-join.txt*
============================================================

Intelligently split PHP arrays across multiple lines and join them to one
line. A trailing comma is inserted on the last element on split and removed on
join. It also handles nested arrays incrementally.

						if the array grows past the maximum line length.
									*<LocalLeader>js*
